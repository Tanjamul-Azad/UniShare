| Category | Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, React Router DOM, Zod, Lucide-React |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, Better-SQLite3 |
| **Testing** | Vitest, React Testing Library, JSDOM |
| **CI/CD** | Automated GitHub Actions workflows for UI deployments |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanjamul-Azad/UniShare.git
   cd UniShare
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   > *Note: This will execute the runner which concurrently spins up the frontend Vite environment and the backend Express/Socket.io node instance.*

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to the local URL output in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## 🧪 Testing

The repository uses `Vitest` as the testing framework.

* **Run all tests once:**  
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
* **Run tests in watch mode:**  
  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

---

## 📦 Production Build

To compile the project for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates production-ready static assets positioned inside the `frontend/dist` directory.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The frontend logic is configured to deploy directly to **GitHub Pages**. 

Every push to the `main` branch will seamlessly trigger a Github Action that creates and deploys a static web build.

> **⚠️ Backend Hosting Note:**  
> If you are going to host the live Socket.IO API server for a production audience, you will need to host the backend separately in an environment compatible with running Node.js engines (e.g. Render, Railway, DigitalOcean, Heroku) and update the client-side API target URLs.
